# Capstone Selection

## Ideas
- We use [Socrative](https://www.socrative.com/) for this process
- Instructors will create a question and distribute the link to participants
- Participants will follow the link and type 1 to 2 sentence ideas in the form
- Instructors will go down the list and lead brief discussion to clarify ideas
- Instructors will eliminate non-appropriate ideas
- too ambitious: not enough time to code in 7 weeks
- content irrelevant: more appropriate for another platform
- What Makes a Good Idea
- fun: you're going to spend 60 hours a week on this
- semi-original: take an idea and put your own personality into it
- shareable: something you can explain to mom with a smile
